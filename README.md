# Final_Master_Project
This jupyter notebook contains the codes that I developed during my Final Master Poject which is called "First-Passage Stochastic Functionals for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process". 

The framework of this project is stochastic processes and I have used simultaion in order to verify some theoretical results. Some of these results were already well known but others are new.

The work models a Brownian particle under the influence of a quadratic potential and it focuses on the first-passage observables which represent some magnitudes associated with the process till a certain target is hit, that is, till the stochastic variable that represents the process takes a specific value.

The main goal of each cell is to display a plot representing a result of the project, which is divided into 3 parts:
  - FIRST PART. GENERAL FEATURES OF THE ORNSTEIN-UHLENBECK PROCESS: In this section we generate the plots of the stochastic variable as a function of time, its mean, its mean-squared and the probability distribution of the stochastic variable depending on time. We are always comparing the studied process with the limit in which there is no potential (standard Brownian motion).
  - SECOND PART. THREE FIRST-PASSAGE STOCHASTIC FUNCTIONALS: In this section we get the results of the first-passage time, area till the first-passage time and residence time till the first-passage time.
  - THIRD PART. GENERALIZATION IN TWO DIMENSIONS: In this last section, we try to generalize the behavior of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck prorcess to two dimensions. First the main characteristics of the process are obtained and then a specific study of first-passage observables is tackled.
